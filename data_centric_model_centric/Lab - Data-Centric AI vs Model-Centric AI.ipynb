    "This lab gives an introduction to data-centric vs model-centric approaches to machine learning problems, showing how data-centric approaches can outperform purely model-centric approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll build a classifier for product reviews (restricted to the magazine category), like:\n",

    "> Excellent! I look forward to every issue. I had no idea just how much I didn't know.  The letters from the subscribers are educational, too.\n",

    "Label: ⭐️ (bad)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with a dataset that has some issues, and we'll see how we can squeeze only so much performance out of the model by being clever about model choice, searching for better hyperparameters, etc. Then, we'll take a look at the data (as any good data scientist should), develop an understanding of the issues, and use simple approaches to improve the data. Finally, we'll see how improving the data can improve results."
